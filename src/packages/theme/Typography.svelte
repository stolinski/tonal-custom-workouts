	Learning to drop in on a skateboard is an exciting and challenging milestone for any skateboarder.
	Before attempting to drop in, ensure that you have a solid foundation of basic skateboarding
	skills, such as balancing, pushing, and stopping. It's also crucial to wear proper protective
	gear, including a helmet, wrist guards, elbow pads, and knee pads.

	.readable - Readable Text - To begin, find a suitable ramp or quarter pipe that matches your skill
	level. Start by standing on the deck of the ramp, with your skateboard positioned perpendicular to
	the coping (the metal edge at the top of the ramp). Place your front foot on the bolts of your
	skateboard, near the front truck, and your back foot on the tail of the board.
